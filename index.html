            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, My name is <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/jacob.vires">Jacob Pearsall</a>. I have long been the avid computer user. 
                I began to dive more into the "how" of computers when I was in 9th grade. In the schools AFJROTC department I was in charge of the website. 
                The next summer I attended a weeklong class on HTML. I continued to develop the website over the next year, and then left the AFJROTC 
                program. I didn't touch any coding again until college. 
            </p>
            <p>In college I studied Computer Science for a little bit, I changed majors a few times and realized I didn't know what I wanted
                to do. In 2013 I took a "break" from college to do an internship at Walt Disney World. This internship turned into a job and I left
                college behind for many years. In 2020 when the world shut down I decided to continue my education. I finished my Bachelors in 
                Computer Science in May 2021. Not having any idea as to what came next, and working for Disney who pays for my education, I 
                decided to pursue my Masters. 
            </p>

                    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
                    <p>
                        After completing my Masters degree I would like to stay with Disney and utilize my degree. I think a good
                        stepping off point would be a social media manager position for Marvel, or Pixar. Being able to utilize my
                        skills within a company I admire and respect would be amazing! I also want to continue doing volunteer work 
                        for Come Out With Pride Orlando, where I am the IT Manager.
